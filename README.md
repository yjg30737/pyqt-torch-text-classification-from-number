Example of Text Classification Using Numbers with a PyTorch Model in a Python PyQt GUI

In this example, the text classification model is utilized for diagnosing diabetes based on provided values.

The trained dataset is presented as follows.

See the "Outcome" column; 0 indicates a negative result, and 1 indicates a positive result, suggesting the presence of diabetes in the patient's record.

You can see the dataset in the "input" tab on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/yoonjunggyu/pytorch-text-classification-supervised-learning">Kaggle Notebook</a> and find the source code as well.

Generated model is already included in the repo.
